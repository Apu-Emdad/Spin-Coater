# Low Cost Spin Coater

This project provides a low-cost solution for a spin coater using an Arduino. The system allows users to input the desired RPM and duration, and it automatically controls the spin coater to achieve the specified parameters.

## Features

- **RPM Control**: Users can input the desired RPM (with a maximum of 5000 RPM).
- **Duration Control**: Users can input the duration in minutes (with a minimum of 1 minute).
- **Real-time RPM Display**: The LCD displays the current RPM during operation.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple keypad-based input with options to start or cancel the operation.

## Hardware Requirements

- **Arduino UNO R3** (or any compatible Arduino board)
- **20x4 I2C LCD Display**
- **4x4 Keypad**
- **ESC (Electronic Speed Controller)**
- **BLDC Motor**
- **IR Sensor** (used as a tachometer)
- **12V Power Supply**
- **Miscellaneous**: Breadboard, wires, resistors, etc.

## Installation

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

First, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Apu-Emdad/Spin-Coater
cd spin-coater
```

### Step 2: Install Arduino IDE

If you don't already have the Arduino IDE installed, download and install it from the official [Arduino website](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/).

### Step 3: Install Required Libraries

The project uses the following Arduino libraries:

- **LiquidCrystal_I2C**: For the I2C LCD display.
- **Keypad**: For reading input from the keypad.
- **Servo**: For controlling the ESC.

You can install these libraries directly from the Arduino IDE:

1.  Open the Arduino IDE.
2.  Go to `Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries...`.
3.  In the Library Manager, search for the following libraries and install them:
    - `LiquidCrystal_I2C`
    - `Keypad`
    - `Servo`

### Step 4: Upload the Code

1.  Open the `spin_coater.ino` file in the Arduino IDE.
2.  Select your Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Mega 2560) from the `Tools > Board` menu.
3.  Select the correct port from the `Tools > Port` menu.
4.  Click on the upload button (right arrow icon) to upload the code to your Arduino.

### Step 5: Connect the Hardware

Connect all the hardware components according to the circuit diagram. Double-check the connections to avoid any issues.

### Step 6: Run the Spin Coater

1.  Once the code is uploaded, power up your Arduino.
2.  Follow the on-screen instructions on the LCD:
    - **Enter RPM**: Use the keypad to enter the desired RPM (maximum 5000 RPM).
    - **Enter Duration**: Use the keypad to enter the duration in minutes (minimum 1 minute).
    - Press `*` to start the spin coater or `#` to cancel.
3.  The system will display the current RPM in real-time and stop once the set duration has passed.

### Step 7: Debugging & Troubleshooting

- If the LCD display doesnâ€™t turn on, double-check the wiring and I2C address.
- Ensure that all connections are secure and components are functioning properly.
